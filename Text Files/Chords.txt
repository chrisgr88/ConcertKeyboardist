Chord toolbar

Non-chord notes
	- Step
	- Target note
	- Note name
	- Time Stamp
	- Velocity
	- Beat/measure
	- Duration
	- Time to next note
	- Overlap time
	- Articulation


Chord Notes
	- Time offset
	- Derived time
	- Velocity offset
	- Derived velocity
	- Duration offset
	- Derived duration
	- Sustainable
	- Position relative to root (inversions)

	Minimum need to cover melodyne exports
	- Velocity
	- Duration
	- Define chords for export to notation software
	- Create and edit sustain

	To Do For Chords
	- Assign note timing properties to chords
		- Manual note times adjustable by dragging 
		- Arpeggiated & randomized note times (arpeggiation slope (+/-), randomization amplitude, randomization seed)
	- Assign velocities to chord notes
		- Manual velocities settable by drag in drag bar UI displayed to left of chord
		- Algorithmic velocities based on pattern of factors (from on top note, or from weighted total chord amplitude?)
	- DONE Connect add/delSustain, add/delSoft, and add/delChord to command manager & create keyboard shortcuts
	- Autocreate chords from chained notes: chords start at firstInChain, constrained by a maximum time after firstInChain)
	- UI for above
	- DONE Hide chord toolbar by default
	- Move icons to the right 
	- DONE Select all notes in chord upon a mouse-up on vertical bar
	- DONE Change chord bar colour (to yellow?) if all notes in the chord are selected.  This marks the chord as selected.
	- Drag chords by clicking on vertical bar and dragging on any note.  (Same group-drag mechanism as for any group of notes)
	- Prevent dropping notes on a different chord
	- Prevent dropping a chord overlapping a different chord
	- Undo for chord creation/deletion
	- Mark document changed on chord creation/deletion

	- UI To Edit Chord Properties
		- Chord note timing type (manual, random, arpeggiate & choose slope (and add random))
		- Chord velocity type (original? , pattern, algorithm)

	- Editing
		- Mark document changed on drag editing
		- Editing by dragging velocity, time or duration affects all selected notes (proportionally or literally?)
		- Undo for drag editing velocity, time or duration
		- Normalize velocities in a range

	- Other
		- Duplicate [ck] in file name on save as of file already with [ck] in its name
