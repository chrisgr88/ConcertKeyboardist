Mac Build Process (do before Windows build)

Mac Installer Creation
- Ensure up to date with repo
- Insert the version information versionLabel.setText in AboutWindow.h.  In the format below.
- Export from Projucer
- Patch juce_AudioProcessor.cpp in JUCE Modules, as below
- Do a "release" build
- Ensure the About window shows the correct information
- Duplicate the Template Folder in the Installers/Mac directory
- Rename it "Concert Keyboardist Installer - ", appending the version number e.g. "Version 1.0 alpha"
- Copy the latest ConcertKeyboardist.app release build into it
- Copy the latest "Concert Keyboardist Files" folder into it
- Compress it (note that the folder background is not retained so we just use a readme file for now.)
- Create a tag on github
- Upload to release server
- Build and upload most recent version of help
- Build and upload most recent version of index.htm
- Download on different system and test


Asserts to disable in juce_AudioProcessor.cpp:
=============================================
    // failed to find a compatible input configuration
    jassert (success);

    if (getTotalNumOutputChannels() != newNumOuts)
        success &= setChannelLayoutOfBus (false, 0, AudioChannelSet::canonicalChannelSet (newNumOuts));

    // failed to find a compatible output configuration
    jassert (success);

    // if the user is using this method then they do not want any side-buses or aux outputs
    success &= disableNonMainBuses();
    jassert (success);

    // the processor may not support this arrangement at all
    jassert (success && newNumIns == getTotalNumInputChannels() && newNumOuts == getTotalNumOutputChannels());
