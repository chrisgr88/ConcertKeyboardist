Mac Build Process (do before Windows build)

Mac Installer Creation
- Ensure up to date with repo
- Apply the "patch" to setPlayConfigDetails, given below
- Insert the version information versionLabel.setText in AboutWindow.h.  In the format below.
- Do a "release" build
- Ensure the About window shows the correct information
- Duplicate the Template Folder in the Installers/Mac directory
- Rename it as follows, appending the version number e.g. "Version: 1.0.0 alpha"
- Copy the latest ConcertKeyboardist.app release build into it
- Copy the latest "Concert Keyboardist Files" folder into it
- Compress it
- Create a tag on github
- Upload to release server
- Build and upload most recent version of help
- Build and upload most recent version of index.htm
- Download on different system and test

        success &= setChannelLayoutOfBus (false, 0, AudioChannelSet::canonicalChannelSet (newNumOuts));

    jassert (success);

    // if the user is using this method then they do not want any side-buses or aux outputs
    success &= disableNonMainBuses();
//    jassert (success);

    // the processor may not support this arrangement at all
//    jassert (success && newNumIns == getTotalNumInputChannels() && newNumOuts == getTotalNumOutputChannels());
