<h2 id="quick-introduction-to-concert-keyboardist">Quick Introduction to Concert Keyboardist</h2>
<p>Concert Keyboardist is like an easy to learn expressive musical instrument that never lets you play a wrong note. Load a midi file and it becomes an instrument for performing a particular piece of music where you control in real time when and how notes are played. It's magical to play like a &quot;Concert Keyboardist&quot; on your computer keyboard. Or use a midi keyboard for even more expressiveness.</p>
<p>Where to get midi files to play? There are tens of thousands available around the Internet for download or you can create your own. With any other application replaying a midi file is always exactly the same and can sound mechanical. With Concert Keyboardist you bring it to life under your fingers as you play.</p>

<p><strong>How it works</strong>: In the above image the heads of the &quot;Target Notes&quot; have magenta heads and &quot;Chained&quot; notes have white or grey heads. Each successive key (any key) you press, Concert Keyboardist triggers the next successive Target Note in the score. It also schedules any notes Chained off each target note for autoplaying according to the tempo. Chained accompaniment notes continue to play while you play overlapping target notes from the melody. You can play polyphonic music and even complex chords easily. You can even play music with multiple midi channels playing multiple instruments, or mute any combination of channels to concentrate on some part of the music.</p>
<p>As you play the score scrolls right-to-left based on tempos set in the score's midi file. You control when to play target notes and how long to hold them. Concert keyboardist continually keeps you visually informed on played notes, currently sounding notes, and upcoming unplayed target notes, and marks suggested times to play them at the current tempo. This carefully designed note triggering system and ongoing visual feedback is crucial to the ability to play a midi file live. More than two years of testing went into perfecting it.</p>
<p>Played with a computer keyboard Concert Keyboardist uses note velocities from the score. Played with a velocity sensitive midi keyboard Concert Keyboardist uses velocities from the keyboard for the target notes. Velocities of chained notes are adjusted proportional to the velocity of their target note.</p>
<p>Concert Keyboardist gradually adjusts its tempo (rate of scrolling) toward your playing tempo. You are not locked to the tempo in the midi file, and you don't have to play target notes exactly when Concert Keyboardist suggests. If you did play them exactly when suggested and hold them exactly as long as suggested, the result would be exactly like playing back the midi file. But even if you tried to do this your natural human variations would bring life to the music, or you could play notes at times that feel right to you, or a different rhythm.</p>
<p>Concert Keyboardist has tools to edit things like note velocities, note start times, note durations, and variations in the tempo. You can save your edited scores in Concert Keyboardist files, which are normal midi files but with an extra invisible track for your edits.</p>
<p>However, it's important to understand that in this version of Concert keyboardist it's not possible to create scores or add and remove notes. There are many powerful applications for creating and manipulating midi files, but Concert Keyboardist is unique in its ability to allow you to &quot;perform&quot; them under real time control.</p>
<h2 id="installation-and-setup-on-a-macintosh">Installation and Setup on a Macintosh</h2>
<p>Concert Keyboardist is compatible with Mac OS 10.6 or higher. To install:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and uncompress the install files.</li>
<li>Copy the Concert keyboardist application to your Applications folder.<br />
</li>
<li>Copy the included &quot;Concery Keyboardist Files&quot; folder to anywhere you choose: your Documents folder, Desktop, or a folder where you keep midi files.</li>
<li>Concert keyboardist can produce sound with a VST or Audio Unit plugin, or by sending midi to another software or hardware synthesizer.<br />
</li>
<li>If you are familiar with plugins and have a suitable one on your computer (e.g. piano) load it as described in <a href="#plugin-management-tools">Plugin Management Tools</a>, and configure the Concert Keyboardist audio output as described in Audio and Midi Settings in <a href="#settings-tools">Settings Tools</a>.<br />
</li>
<li>Instead of a plugin you can route midi from Concert keyboardist to a standlaone software or hardware synthesizer. The easiest option on a Macintosh is to use GarageBand which is free and has a wide range of sounds to choose from. GarageBand automatically receives midi messages from all midi output on your system so it automatically receives from the Concert Keyboardist default output.</li>
<li>To set up with GarageBand:
<ul>
<li>Download and install GarageBand (it's free to Mac owners).<br />
</li>
<li>Open GarageBand.</li>
<li>When it opens choose &quot;Empty Project&quot;</li>
<li>Choose &quot;Software Instrument&quot;. It should default to Classic Electric Piano.</li>
<li>You could play the Classic Electric Piano but it's better to use a true piano sound for the piano music included with Concert Keyboardist.</li>
<li>To choose a piano sound click on &quot;Sounds&quot; in the frame on the left, click on &quot;Piano&quot; and double click on &quot;Steinway Grand Piano&quot;.</li>
<li>Then open Concert Keyboardist and follow the steps in <a href="#quick-start-to-playing">Quick Start to Playing</a>, below. When you play you should hear piano notes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you are more experienced with midi you should know how to configure your preferred midi synthesizer to receive from the Concert Keyboardist default output.</li>
<li>If you have a midi keyboard attached to your computer, configure it as the Concert Keyboardist midi input as shown in Audio and Midi Settings in <a href="#settings-tools">Settings Tools</a>. Be sure your controller is active when Concert Keyboardist is started.</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="#quick-start-to-playing">Quick Start to Playing</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation-and-setup-on-windows">Installation and Setup on Windows</h2>
<p>Concert Keyboardist is compatible with Windows 7 and Windows 10 (possibly Windows XT but this has not been tested). To install:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the Windows installer.</li>
<li>Double click on the installer to run it and follow the prompts.<br />
</li>
<li>It will install Concert Keyboardist to your Programs folder and create a directory called &quot;Concert Keyboardist Files&quot; of example files in your Documents directory.</li>
<li>Run Concert Keyboardist. You should find shortcuts to Concert Keyboardist on Desktop and in the Start menu. If you wish, pin it to the Taskbar.</li>
<li>Configure the Concert Keyboardist audio output as described in the Audio and Midi Settings in <a href="#settings-tools">Settings Tools</a>.</li>
<li>Concert keyboardist can produce sound with a VST plugin, or by sending midi to another application.</li>
<li>If you are familiar with audio plugins and have any on your computer, load a suitable one (e.g. piano) as described in the <a href="#plugin-management-tools">Plugin Management Tools</a> section below.</li>
<li>Instead of a plugin you can route midi from Concert keyboardist to a standalone software or hardware synthesizer.<br />
</li>
<li>To route midi to a software synthesizer will need a virtual midi routing driver such as <a href="http://www.nerds.de/en/loopbe1.html">LoopBee</a>, which is free for the basic version, which is sufficient.<br />
</li>
<li>Install LoopBee, or the equivalent. Then choose it as both the Concert Keyboardist midi output as described in Audio and Midi Settings in <a href="#settings-tools">Settings Tools</a>. Also set LoopBee as the input port on your software synthesizer.</li>
<li>If you have an external hardware synthesizer attached to your computer, choose that as the Concert Keyboardist midi output.</li>
<li>On your synthesizer choose a suitable sound such as piano.</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="#quick-start-to-playing">Quick Start to Playing</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quick-start-to-playing">Quick Start to Playing</h2>
<ul>
<li>If at any point you need more detail, refer to the <a href="#overview-of-the-main-window">Overview of The Main Window</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Load a file:</strong> You can use the File-Open menu, the toolbar button, or Cmd+O. A good introductory example is &quot;Minuet in G[ck].mid&quot; which is among the example files. When loaded it should look something like the image in the <a href="#overview-of-the-main-window">Overview of The Main Window</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare to play:</strong> Press the spacebar. This turns the Current Time Line orange, indicating that Concert Keyboardist is ready to play. In this mode as soon as you press a key the note at the Current Time Line is played and the note bars start scrolling to the left. The scroll rate is based on the tempo.</li>
<li><strong>Triggering Notes:</strong> On your computer keyboard press any letter key, or any of the characters &quot;[ ] ; ' &lt; &gt; and /&quot;. On an English language keyboard these are the rows from &quot;q&quot; to &quot;]&quot;, from &quot;a&quot; to &quot; ' &quot; and from &quot;z&quot; to &quot;/&quot;. If you are using a midi keyboard playing <strong>any</strong> note triggers the next target note.</li>
<li><strong>Note Timing:</strong> To play at the original tempo and rhythm press a key each time a target note reaches the vertical yellow line drawn when the previous note was played. You can play with one finger, or two or more fingers to play faster or smoother.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Stopping:</strong> Press the spacebar again, or press the Return key for rewind, or roll the mouse wheel to scroll left or right.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow note heads</strong> are those that are currently sounding. As you play, notice that long notes continue sounding even as you trigger shorter simultaneous notes.</li>
<li><strong>Chords:</strong> In the &quot;Minuet in G&quot; example the top notes of chords are target notes. Simultaneous or nearby chord notes are chained from them, like any other chained notes. This allows chords to be triggered by one note..</li>
<li><strong>Trills</strong> are like any other chained notes. For example in bar 8 of Minuet in G the notes are chained making them easier to play.</li>
<li><strong>Rewind:</strong> Press the Return key. The first time you press Return the transport rewinds to the place you most recently started. A second press returns to the start. You can also press Return while the transport is running to stop and transport and rewind in one step.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Editing</strong> You can edit which notes are target notes. Click on the head a note to toggle its target vs chained status. Setting a note to be chained causes it to be added to the chain of the preceding target note.</li>
<li><strong>Playing legato notes</strong> This is a technique where the on and off times of successive notes are overlapped resulting in smooth sounding transitions. If you play with at least two fingers you can overlap the on and off times of successive notes to create legato as in normal piano playing.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The Relative Time Line:</strong> This is the yellow vertical line that appears at the start of the most recently played target note. The Relative Time Line is a guide to when to play the next target note relative to when you played this note. In playing expressively you may be triggering notes before or after the Current Time Line. It's helpful to have a relative time marker showing when notes were actually played, not when they were suggested to be played. Experiment with playing notes before or after the Current Time Line to understand this better. The yellow line remains after you stop playing to mark the last note played before stopping.</li>

<h2 id="overview-of-the-main-window">Overview of The Main Window</h2>
<ul>
<li>Concert Keyboardist is like a player piano. <strong>Notes</strong> are horizontal bars that scroll right to left horizontally based on the current <strong>tempo</strong>. A note's vertical position shows pitch and its left end shows start time. Its length shows duration. This information is read from the midi file and guides you when to play notes and how long to hold them.</li>
<li>In real time while you play <strong>you control note start times and durations</strong>. This is like playing sheet music. The notes are there but you add expression as you play. If you have a velocity sensitive midi keyboard you can also control note velocities.</li>
<li>The score can be <strong>scrolled</strong> left or right with the mouse wheel or two finger drag on a touch pad. The end of the score is at the far right.</li>
<li>The blue vertical line is the <strong>&quot;Current Time Line&quot;</strong> which indicates the current playing time in the score. It turns amber when ready to play and green while you are playing.</li>
<li>While you are playing, pressing any key instantly triggers the next unplayed <strong>Target Note</strong>, magenta-headed-notes. The these are the notes you directly play.</li>
<li>When a Target Note is played it also schedules for playing all notes <strong>chained</strong> from it up to just before the next target note. Chained notes are those without magenta heads.<br />
</li>
<li>Chained notes are triggered at appropriate times in the future based on the current tempo.</li>
<li>After all scheduled chained notes have been played no further notes will sound until you trigger the next target note.</li>
<li>Although a target note's position suggests its start time, you can play it before or after that time, giving you control over the <strong>flow and rhythm</strong> of the music. The <strong>tempo</strong> gradually adjusts itself to your playing speed. If you continually play notes before their scheduled time the tempo speeds up and if you play notes behind the tempo slows.</li>
<li>If you try to play the next target note while previously chained notes are still playing, that target note and its chained notes are added to the previous chain.</li>
<li>Each time you trigger a target note a vertical yellow <strong>&quot;Relative Time Line&quot;</strong> is drawn at that exact position as a guide to when to play the next target note. To play the upcoming target note at the current tempo, play it when it reaches the Relative Time Line. You are free to play it earlier or later which alters the timing of that note and its chained notes. i.e. The feel or rhythm of the music. If you continue playing early or late the tempo gradually slows or speeds up.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="navigating-around-the-score">Navigating Around The Score</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scroll</strong> with the touchpad or mouse wheel.<br />
</li>
<li>Press the <strong>Return Key</strong> to go where you most recently started playing. Press a second time to return to the start.</li>
<li><strong>The Right and Left arrow keys</strong> step one target note at a time forward or backward in the score.</li>
<li><strong>The Shift+Right Arrow and Shift+Left Arrow keys</strong> step one measure at a time forward or backward in the score.</li>
<li><strong>Bookmarks:</strong> Cmd+Right Arrow and Cmd+Left Arrow (Ctrl on Windows) step one bookmark at a time forward or backward in the score.</li>
<li>Press Cmd+b to create a bookmark at the Current Time Line. To delete a bookmark press Cmd+b with the bookmark already at the Current Time Line.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="selecting-notes">Selecting Notes</h2>
<p>Many commands act on &quot;selected notes&quot;. To select a range of notes move the mouse pointer to anywhere not on a note bar, press the left mouse button and drag over the heads of notes to be selected and release the mouse button. The head of each selected note will be surrounded by a white box. To clear the selection click anywhere there is not a note bar.</p>
<p>To add notes to the selection hold down the shift key while some notes are selected and drag the marquee around other notes. They will also become selected.</p>
<p>To remove notes from the selection hold down the Option key and drag, starting with some notes selected. Any selected notes you drag the marquee over will become unselected.</p>
<p>If you drag past the right or left end of the score the score will autoscroll and stop if it reaches that end of the score.</p>
<p>To select all notes in the score use the keyboard shortcut Cmd+a on Mac or Ctrl+a on Windows. Press the Escape key to unselect all notes.</p>
<p>You can't select a single note by clicking directly on its head. This toggles it between being a target or non target note. To select a single note, start on the background near it and drag a marquee around it.</p>
<h2 id="note-information-viewer">Note Information Viewer</h2>
<p><img src="../Common/img/Information Area.jpg" alt="CK" style="width:30%;margin:0px 0px 0px 10px"></p>
<p>The Note Information Viewer is in the lower left corner of the main window. Hovering the mouse pointer over a note bar shows details on the note.Hovering over a light or dark grey note track reveals the note name and octave of that track. Dragging on the display to select a range of notes shows details of the selection: The time in ticks of its first and last note and the duration in ticks from the first to the last note.</p>

<h3 id="file-management-tools">File Management Tools</h3>
<p><img src="../Common/img/FileManagementTools.jpg" alt="CK" style="width:9%;margin:0px 0px 0px 10px"></p>
<p>There are buttons for &quot;File Open&quot;, &quot;File Save&quot; and &quot;File Save As&quot;. These do the same as the &quot;Open&quot;, &quot;Save&quot; and &quot;Save As&quot; commands in the File menu, and are very similar to commands you are probably know from other applications.</p>
<p>File Open will open either normal midi files (extension .mid) or Concert Keyboardist files (extension [CK].mid). Opening a normal midi file automatically imports it.</p>
<p>When you save a file, it becomes a Concert keyboardist file and the [CK] marker is added before the extension. Because it's also a normal midi files you should be able to load it into any other application that loads midi files.</p>
<p>If you re-save a [CK].mid file from another application Concert Keyboardist may or may not retain any customizations. These are in an extra track encoded in &quot;system exclusive&quot; format. Whether another application retains sysex tracks depends on the application.</p>

<p>Editing to set target and non-target notes for a long midi file would be a lot of work! Fortunately the chain command is an easier way do most of the work automatically. We usually want each target note to follow a break in the flow of notes. Notes that are closer together we would want to be chained from the preceding target note.</p>
<p>The chain command acts on a selected range of notes, or the entire midi file. The numeric field next to the chain button gives the size of the break in sixteenth notes that should trigger a target note to be marked. What works best for a given midi file make take some experimentation, but an amount of 1.0 sixteenths works well for a lot of files.</p>
<p>The chain command is automaticaly run with an interval of one sixteenth when a midi file is first imported. This usually results in a quite playable file depending on its complexity. To try other intervals select a range or all notes in the score. Then click on the &quot;chain amount&quot; number in the toolbar, and choose some other amount from the popup list. The selected range of notes will instantly be rechained based on that interval.</p>
<p>If you don't like the result you can undo it. If it's close to what you want you can adjust some notes using the <a href="#toggle-target-notes-tool">Toggle Target Notes Tool</a>.</p>
<p>The chain button reapplies chain command using the visible &quot;chain amount&quot; number.</p>
<p>After chaining, usually only one note in a chord (unless it's a long broken chord) is set as a target note. The other notes are chained from it, either simultaneous or offset slightly in time. The note that came first is made the target note, which is not necessarily the top note or bottom note of the chord as you might expect. This is why it may appear somewhat arbitrary which note of a chord becomes a target note.</p>
<p>Slight variations in chord note start times result in more natural sounding music. If they were present in the original midi file (probably because it was recorded live by a real human) they are retained and automatically replayed at the current tempo when you trigger the chord's target note. Midi files that were manually entered or step-sequenced usually do not have these subtle variations in chord times but you can simulate them with one of the Concert Keyboardist <a href="#chord-tools">Chord Tools</a>.</p>

<p>Show Edit Toolbar : Toggles the hiding and showing of the edit toolbar. This is the same as the equivalent toolbar button.</p>
<p>Hide Measure Lines : Toggles the hiding and showing of the measure and beat lines on the score. The reason you may want to do this is that most midi files that were recorded by a live performer do not have their notes aligned to the beat or measure lines. They were simply recorded at some constant tempo with the played note occuring in no particular relatinship to the measures of the nominal tempo. You can identify a midi file like this when the notes seem to bear no relationship to the beats and measure. The numerical tempo is also almost always constant at some value like 120 beats per minute. For files like this it's usually better to hide the beat and measure lines to remove clutter and avoid confusion at you play, where you might be expecting the lines to be relevant. If you turn off beat and measure lines this property is saved with the [CK].mid file and retained next time it is opened.</p></li>
