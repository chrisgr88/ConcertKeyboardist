Concert Keyboardist is like a musical instrument that never lets you play a wrong note. Load a midi file and Concert Keyboardist becomes an instrument to perform that music expressively, not just to listen passively. You control when and how notes are played, in real time. Play like a "Concert Keyboardist" with just your computer keyboard, or use a midi keyboard for even more control.
