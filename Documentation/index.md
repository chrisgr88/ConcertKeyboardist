Concert Keyboardist is like a musical instrument that never lets you play a wrong note. Load a midi file and Concert Keyboardist becomes an instrument to perform that music expressively, not just to listen to passively. You control when and how notes are played in real time. Play like a "Concert Keyboardist" with just your computer keyboard or use a midi keyboard for even more control.

Pressing any key on the keyboard or note on the midi keyboard triggers the next "target note" in the score at the exact time the key is 
pressed.  Each note chained from a target note is played with the correct delay after the target note, according to the current tempo.  Unplayed target notes are magenta.  Chained notes and already-played notes are grey.

You are in complete control of note timing, durations and variations in tempo.

With a computer keyboard, note velocities are taken from the midi file:

With a MIDI keyboard note, velocities are taken from the keypresses on the keyboard:
