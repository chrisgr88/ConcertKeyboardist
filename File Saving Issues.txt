Work Plan - Saving User Edit to Midi File
- Create new tagged sysex track "OriginalNotes" that contains original midi file's note ons and offs.
- Change ck file loading to construct theSequence from the OriginalNotes track if present (it should be).
	- If OriginalNotes is not present then the ck file was edited outside CK
		- If the Ck sequence is still the active sequence then use the active sequence OriginalNotes to reconstruct memory image
		- If not still in memory warn the user and load the midi notes from the normal tracks (which could lose chord info)

File Saving Issues

Note Data - for changed notes, or all?
- velocities
- note number
- time stamp
- off time
- channel?

Chords
- Remember which notes are grouped as part of a chord
- Remember ck chord property for each chord
- On loading generate ck adjusted velocity & time/duration for each note
- Ck chord properties - see below

Other ornamentations? 
 - Remember which notes are grouped as part of this element
 - trills
 - grace notes
 - etc.
 - Remember properties of this element

 Program Changes
 	- For whole track
 	- Multiple within a track

 Sustains

 Softs

 Tempos

 Annotations

 Capabilities
  - Save as standard midi file
  - When loaded by another app should it get the edited version, or not?
  - Especially chords
  	- If we save chords with CK time changes a notation app will no longer see them as chords
  	- So saved midi file must put all chord notes at the same time
  	- Even chord notes that were previously not simultaneous, when marked as a chord are saved as simultaneous
  - But it would still be useful to be able to choose to save with adjusted times/velocities for playing in another app.
  - Ability to record live playing
    - save velocities and on/off times for re-listening or export for use elsewhere
    - A user played recording's on/off times & velocities should be in a special sysex track
    - Ability to keep user played timing but alter chord styles?

 Storage
  - Store tags as a sequence of sysex records.  
  	- Mark chords by time stamp (like target notes)
  	- All notes in loaded sequence at that time stamp are considered to be part of that chord
  	- Each chord record includes chord styling properties for that chord
  - Ability to export a midi file that uses "adjusted" note time/velocity data
  - Ability to export a user played version

  Chords
  	- Command to mark a selection of notes to be treated as a chord (does not directly affect their timing or velocities)
  	- Chord note options
  		- Timing
  			- Custom times
  			- Broken times 
  				- top note first or bottom note first 
  				- lag between notes ("slope")
  				- amount of randomness & seed
  		- Voicing
  			- Custom velocities
  			- Random
  			- Automatic
  	- Ability to copy and paste a set of chord properties from one chord to others
  	- Library of chord timing options and voicing options
  	- Ability to use some sort of machine learning model to adjust timing and velocities?

Issues
  	- Back and forth to notation software
  		- Save with chord notes simultaneous
  		- Edit in notation
  		- Save in notation (ckf data may be lost)
  		- ck detects file and auto reloads 
  		- ck matches notes based on track and time stamp
  		- regenerates chord velocity and timing styles

Ability to work with Melodyne to create midi files or apply velocities/timing to midi files
