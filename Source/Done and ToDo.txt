Updated ToDo as of December 22, 2017
--------------------------------
- FIXED Documents are marked as changed on first loading

- HANDLED Audio/MIDI Setup does not contain the CK virtual port.
- FIXED The CK virtual midi port is always the output used by MidiProcessor

- FIXED Loading a sequence when a plugin is already loaded - plugin is used for new sequence unless manually unloaded
- FIXED Command to unload plugin 

- HANDLED Command to enable/disable midi port -> Always enabled for a new sequence unless it was disabled
- FIXED Loading a sequence with no plugin assigned caused midi out to be enabled.

App Properties Dialog
Score Properties Dialog
    - Selection of which tracks to play, to mute or to play as accompaniment
    - Setting of method of note velocity control
    - Channel remappings
    - Controllers to autoplay from original file (sustain, soft, other?)
    - Tempo options: fixed, as in original file, fully dynamic (edit parameters on degree of control)

Better direct editing
    DONE - Easier to click short note bars
    - Pinch to zoom
More external controller features
    - Input of controllers
    - Others?
DONE VST/AU host
DONE Windows version
iOS version - Design the iOS UI. See nanoStudio.
Bugs:
- DONE VProblem with openGL on Hayden variations for four hands? Goes blank? Intermittent.
- DONE VOccasional hang on startup in audio init - timing related

Ability to loop.  Partly working.
    - Loop point specified in ticks is varying in position in score.  Need to specity it in terms of seq step.
    - Find a way to mark looped notes as unplayed
    - Ensure held notes beyond a loop end are handled properly.
    - Create UI to specify loop points.
    - Cause rewind to go to start of loop point?
    - Save loop point in file.

Done
----
- DONE Set chained note velocities based on their original velocity and the user-played velocity of the chain trigger. 
- DONE Selection of which tracks to play, to mute or to play as accompaniment
- DONE Option to not start transport until first note-on is received
- DONE Better tempo display/control (e.g. show original BPM, scaled BPM and real-time BPM)
- NOT FOR NOW Remove empty measures from front of a loaded score
- DONE Ability to detect notes from computer keyboard vs external controller and choose the appropriate velocity source setting
- DONE Save and restore zoom level in score file
- DONE Save and load bookmarks in score file
- DONE Pedal symbols
- DONE Loudness graph
- DONE Step time back/forward through target notes (forward/back arrow)
- DONE Step time back/forward through bars (forward/back arrow)
- DONE Add note number to note bar hover information
- DONE Click on ZTL handle when it's not at the current playing time and not on bookmark does a catchup. If at current playing time a bookmark is added. If there is a bookmark it is removed. Down arrow does similar things. Downarrow when ZTL not at current playing time does a catchup. Downarrow when at current times toggles the presence of a bookmark. 
- DONE Command forward/back arrow moves between bookmarks 
- DONE Fixed bug where the tempo speed multiplier was being reset 1.0 when a file was saved, and some related bug
- DONE Renamed PluginProcessor to MIDIProcessor
- DONE This now instantiated as instance variable "midiProcessor" in MainComponent
- DONE midiProcessor.loadSequence() is called in the constructor of MainComponent
- DONE MainComponent is defined and instantiated as instance variable, "viewerFrame" in MainComponent 
- DONE viewerFrame is passed a pointer to midiProcessor in the constructor of MainComponent using viewerFrame.setProcessor()
- DONE ScrollingNoteViewer is defined and instantiated as instance variable noteViewer in viewerFrame.
- DONE noteViewer is passed a pointer to midiProcessor in the procedure setProcessor(p) in ViewerFrame
- DONE Uses of the variable "processor" in ViewerFrame and ScrollingNoteViewer have been uncommented.
- DONE App builds and calls makeKeyboard but hangs when calling timeSigChanges.size().  Need to investigate
- DONE Pass a pointer to midiProcessor to "viewer"
- DONE Use this reference to re-enable creation of keyboard and note bars in viewer
- DONE Set up MainComponent using definition of keyboard and other parameters to create non-openGL parts of view
- DONE Re-work pulse and time management parts to midiProcessor
- DONE Add UI to start and stop transport
- DONE Add midi output
- DONE Add use of computer keyboard for midi input
- DONE Setting position by clicking on top bar does not correctly set the position.
- DONE Find a way to have MidiProcessor send midi messages by calling sendMidiMessageToSynth(msg) in MainComponent
- DONE Create internal synth 
    - Look into getting sfZero to build as a plugin (in separate project)
    - Merge sfZero into PerfectPlayer (big job?)
    - Enable passing midi to internal synth
        - Only need to so this when running an internal synth.  Otherwise they can be sent immediately to midi output.
        - Put them in a MidiBuffer and pass to a method in MainComponent that adds them to a MidiInputCollector (i.e. sync with audio)
        - audioDeviceIOCallback will remove them and pass to internal synth
        - Be sure to reset the MidiInputCollector as appropriate.
        - See MPETest for more details.
        - Enable a way to choose midi output to go out midi port or to internal synth

DONE Add basic ability to click on note bars to toggle them between being target or nontarget notes.

DONE Add struct for a "chainingRange" descriptor. i.e. startStep, endStep, interval
DONE Define an array of theses structs called chainDescriptors
DONE For now cause the setting of chaining interval to create one element in the array with the 0, maxStep and interval as the values
DONE Create a loop to save a sysex record for each element of the chain entries
DONE Then add ability to load a file and extract the properties - in a simple way
DONE Refactor so all score properties are kept in the Score object and fetched by other objects as needed
DONE Midi Import
DONE File Management
    - Midi files can be loaded but not saved
    - ckf files can be saved and loaded
    - File menu
DONE Reimplement setTempo() and getTempo() to use originalFirstTempo & tempoMultiplier. Design is in Sequence.h: 
    - Actual tempo is the midi file multiplied by tempoMultiplier
    - autoTempo: Tempo starts at originalFirstTempo*tempoMultiplier and then tracks user
    - fixedTempo: Tempo is steady at originalFirstTempo*tempoMultiplier
    - proportionalToOriginalTempo: Tempo is instantaneous tempo from file * tempoMultiplier (does not track user)
DONE In short sequences it's too easy to see the end of the black/white highlights. Widened the bars by 10 times.
DONE Track settings were not being cleared before loading a new sequence.
DONE Before saving a file get values for a sequence as sysex records
DONE On loading clear sequence property set and get values from sysex records into property set
DONE Enable marking a file dirty if changed and prompting to save if it will be lost
    - On exit
    - On loading a new file
DONE If a ppf file has been loaded changes should be automatically saved on exit and restored on reopening app
DONE If a midi file and will be lost we should offer to save a ckf file as in file saveAs
DONE Create ability to save app settings
    - On app open the complete view state should be restored
    - Most recent file (but not if it was an uncnanged midi file?)
    - Window size, position
