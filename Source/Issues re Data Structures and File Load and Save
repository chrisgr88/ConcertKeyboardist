Issues re Data Structures and File Load and Save

- Is it Necessary to Recompute Chord Data When Tracks Are Enabled

- Catalog where is loadSequence is called from, and the Parameters Used

- Do we need a separate chord data array, or could it be combined into allNotes?

- Do we need a separate array to hold original values or could we could we save pointers into the actual file tracks
    - Have pointer in NWOT (noteWithOffTime) to index of entry in original track?
    - What if notes are added?  Added notes have a null value for this pointer

- Editing
    - Enable editing of non-target notes
    - Adjust timeStamp in the targetNotes list when a target note's time is changed
    - Move entire chord when top note is moved
    - Adjust all velocities when top note is changed?
    - Add visual gauges for velocity and time when note is dragged
    - Allow dragging on selection of notes
    - Ability to drag time of chord member notes.  They remain in the chord but their offset is stored in the chord's data.

- File saving
    - Save chord notes at actual times but remember chord membership in sysex? or
    - Save chord notes as simultaneous but remember chord note offsets in sysex?
