To Do Aug 11/17
---------------
- DONE Special data structure to use in sustain and soft pedal arrays
- DONE Method of deleting sustain bars
- DONE Ability to save pedal controller edits
- DONE Option click should not cancel selection
- DONE Add editing for soft pedal same as sustain
- Fix display of soft pedal to be just above sustain bars rather than in top bar
- Undo of bar edits

- Change velocity/time/end editing to be a mode toggled by a toolbar button(s) rather than a shift key
- Show velocities for chord notes
- Undo for velocity editing
- Undo for time stamp editing
- Undo for off time editing

- Chord editing mode/toolbar - shows chord visualizations
- Chord visualization
- Ability to define selected notes to be a chord
- Add other chord styles 
	- user selected note times, arpeggiated
	- UI for choosing
	- Visualization of each chord style

- DONE Tooltips for toolbar

- DONE Add track and tick to hover display 
- DONE Display selection start, end, width while selecting. 
- DONE Add current tick at ZTL to measure display 

Create Chord
------------
ChordDetail properties to create/update:
- int timeStamp;
- std::vector<std::shared_ptr<NoteWithOffTime>> notePointers; //Pointers to chord's notes
- std::vector<int> offsets; //Offsets from timeStamp of chord top note
- std::vector<String> noteIds; //String(track)+"_"+String(channel)+"_"+String(noteNumber)
- Rectangle<float> chordRect; //Rectangle surrounding chord for display and hit testing. Value defined in makeNoteBars.

NoteWithOffTime properties to update
- int chordTopStep;//Highest of the notes of the chord this note is in. Use -1 for highest note and if note is not in a chord.
- int chordIndex;  //Index in chords[ ] of this note's chord, if any. This may change depending on which tracks are active.
- int noteIndexInChord; //The current position of this note in the ChordDetail   

Principles - What is a Chord?
- Chord notes must be contiguous in theSequence
	(Issue: What about intervening notes non active tracks?)
- Notes with a chordIndex>=0 are part of the chord with that index.  
- Chords with a negative chord index are not part of a chord.
- In creating a chord, all the other above properties must also be defined
- Chord notes are stored at their actual times in theSequence
- When a file is saved chord notes are saved in the midi sequence with the same time stamp as the chordTopStep
- The offset of each note to its true time in theSequence is saved in the note's chordNote record sysex
- What if notes have their times determined by an algorithm?
	- each chord note's time is still saved in its chordNote record
	- details of the algorithm are saved in the chordDetail.  When the algorithm is run it should produce those same offsets
- If the offsets were manually set then no algorithm is specified and the offsets in the chordNote records give the note times

Cases
1) None of the selected notes was already in a chord
	- Ensure the notes are contiguous
		(If not, refuse to make a chord?)
	- Create a new chordDetail record and add the notes to it
	- Insert the chordDetail record into the chords array and update all other notes chord references
	- Update all the notes chord related properties
2) Some notes are not in a chord and the remainder comprise all the notes in a single chord.
	- Ensure the notes are contiguous and contiguous to the chord
	- Add the non chord notes to the chord
	- Update all the notes chord related properties
3)	Some notes are not in a chord and the remainder are only part of the notes in a single chord.
	- Ensure the notes are contiguous and contiguous to selectes notes that are inthe chord
	- Add the non chord notes to the chord
	- Remove the notes from that chord that were not selected
	- Update all the notes chord related properties
4)	Some notes are not in a chord and the remainder are only part of the notes in a single chord.
=========
Simplified 
1) Ensure all selected notes are contiguous
2) Find all of the chords that contained at least one of the selected notes and delete all those chords.
3) Create a chord from the selected notes.

Basic action  
- Also need to update 
- Delete all chords
- Set all notes to have same time stamp as highest note
