To Do:
- DONE Selecting unselected notes in marquee subtract mode instead adds them.  Should do nothing.
- DONE Allow click on background to clear selection in selecting modes (make reversible?)
- DONE? Dragging to edit velocities can leave you in resizing mode.
- DONE Shortcut keys for selection modes
- DONE Disable velocity draw mode when a selection mode is enabled?
- DONE Dragging that changes note positions changes their step position and this makes the selection (and other things?) invalid.
- DONE Prevent toggle note activity from creating slaved target notes
- LIKLIHOOD REDUCED: Randomizing chord note times can turn slaved target notes into playable target notes.
- LIKLIHOOD REDUCED: Sometimes active target notes can be hidden behind slaved target notes.
- DONE Humanize velocities is not changing the right notes of chords
- DONE Review what humanize time random seed is derived from.
- DONE Make dragging the top note of a chord move the chord.
- DONE Can't access a note head that's over another note's bar with the mouse
- DONE Eliminate simultaneous target notes on loading
- DONE Remove assumption that chord notes are adjacent.
- DEFER Allow repeated clicks on the background to toggle the current selection rather than close it
- DONE Make marquee selecting on by default?
- DONE Add guidelines for visual alignment when dragging note on and off times. 
- DONE Clean up bottom bar data display
- DEFER Display number of selected notes in bottom bar, preceding the time-range.  Also display first and last selected tick.
- Make drawing easier for velocity edit mode.
- DONE Velocity drag multiple notes
- DONE Duration drag multiple notes
- DEFER Selection filters
