To Do:
- DONE Selecting unselected notes in marquee subtract mode instead adds them.  Should do nothing.
- DONE Allow click on background to clear selection in selecting modes (make reversible?)
- DONE? Dragging to edit velocities can leave you in resizing mode.
- DONE Shortcut keys for selection modes
- DONE Disable velocity draw mode when a selection mode is enabled?
- DONE Dragging that changes note positions changes their step position and this makes the selection (and other things?) invalid.

- DONE Prevent toggle note activity from creating slaved target notes
- LIKLIHOOD REDUCED: Randomizing chord note times can turn slaved target notes into playable target notes.
- LIKLIHOOD REDUCED: Sometimes active target notes can be hidden behind slaved target notes.
- Remove assumption that chord notes are adjacent
- DONE Humanize velocities is not changing the right notes of chords
- DONE Review what humanize time random seed is derived from
- Review what happens when chord notes are dragged.  Make dragging the top note of a chord move the chord?
- Use vector drawing for velocity edit mode.
- Velocity drag multiple notes
- Duration drag multiple notes
