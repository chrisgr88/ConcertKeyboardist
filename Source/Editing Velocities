Editing Velocities
	- allNotes contains
		- velocity (editable by user & changable by chords)
		- originalVelocity (same as originally loaded from file)

	- User can change:
		- Non chord notes
			- Setting stored in allNotes velocity
			- Retained across rebuilds & track changes
			- Stored in main tracks of file
			- Becomes the originalVelocity when file reopened
		- Chord top (active) notes
			- Persisted the same way as non chord notes
		- Chord slave notes
			- With voicing algorithm
			- Manually

Chord velocity goals
	- User can change head note velocity and it adjusts the whole chord
		- Slave note velocities are proportionally adjusted and stored in NWOT.velocity
	- Relative velocities of slave notes to master are stored in the chord detail record?
	- Adjusing velocity of a slave note	changes the relative velocity in the detail record and the actual NWOT.velocity
	- What if notes in multiple tracks are in a chord and some tracks are inactive?
		- The original master may not be present
			- Pretend original master exists, calculate velocities for notes that are really present?
			- or, Designate a temporary master
			- However, In the playing engine there MUST be a designated master in a track that is really in theSequence
		- There may be no slave notes

Therefore we may need a different stored set of activeNotes and chord  definitions for each combination of tracks
	- Or we need named snapshots with given active tracks, and each snapshot has its own definitions of active notes & chords
	- But how to reconcile actual velocities (which are shared among all snapshots) that are stored in the file's midi tracks
